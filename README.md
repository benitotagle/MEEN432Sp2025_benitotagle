You can change the simulink file name on line 24 and 126 of the Part1ProjectGraphs.m file, for some reasons sometimes it changes the name of the simulink file when I tried to save it so it ended up with a weird autogenerated name. To run open both files, run the simulink file first and then the matlab script

Notes regarding part 1:
1. Good workflow keep this format
2. Create individual readmes for part 1 and part 2 so I can understand how each code should run
3. Suggestion: Instead of clicking run on the simulation you can use the load simulation method within your script to run it first.
