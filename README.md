You can change the simulink file name on line 24 and 126 of the Part1ProjectGraphs.m file, for some reasons sometimes it changes the name of the simulink file when I tried to save it so it ended up with a weird autogenerated name. To run open both files, run the simulink file first and then the matlab script
