The first part of the code are all the track and vehicle parameters such as length, radius, etc. The centerline of the track is done using 4 parametric equations that are combined into a single (x,y) list. The straight line sections are drawn by generating a vector of evenly spaced numbers between the start and end value (-450 to 450), since it is straight theta is zero. For the curved sections we also use a linear space but now for angles, theta is for the track angle to get recorded that can be used by the car to align itself depending on what point on the track it is on. After making all for sections we can combine them all into a single x, y and theta waypoints. Based on the track width we made 2 offset tracks + and - 7.5 away from the centerline. The track is then plotted as 3 lines. For the car  it first calculates the distance between each waypoint, using this it interpolates a constant speed for the car instead of following the uneven spacing of the waypoints. For the animation the car moves at constant speed since the new x and y waypoints are equally spaced. A rotation matrix is used to alight the car's rectangle to the direction of the track using the stored theta values. The code also continuously updates the vehicle path with a blue line.
